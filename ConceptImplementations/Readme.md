# What is ECx
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. It introduced several new features and improvements to the language, enhancing its capabilities and making it more expressive and powerful. Some of the key features introduced in ES6 include:

Arrow Functions: A more concise syntax for writing function expressions.
Let and Const Declarations: New ways to declare variables with block scope.
Classes: A new syntax for defining classes and working with inheritance.
Template Literals: A new way to work with strings, allowing for easier interpolation and multiline strings.
Destructuring Assignment: A syntax for extracting values from arrays and objects into variables.
Default Parameters: The ability to specify default values for function parameters.
Rest Parameters: The ability to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
Spread Syntax: A syntax for expanding elements of an array or object into places where multiple elements or key-value pairs are expected.
Modules: A standardized way to organize and reuse code using import and export statements.
Promises: A built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations and managing callbacks.
Symbol: A new primitive data type for creating unique identifiers.
Iterators and Generators: A way to define sequences of values and iterate over them.
ES6 significantly improved the readability, maintainability, and overall developer experience of JavaScript code. Since its introduction, subsequent versions of ECMAScript have been released with additional features and improvements, but ES6 laid the foundation for modern JavaScript development.
